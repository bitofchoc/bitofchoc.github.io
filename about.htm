		<h2>About Us</h2>

		<p>
		This website was made by Sean Shannon and Adam Mooney. We attend DIT Kevin Street and are studying Networking Technologies (DT080A). It was made for our first year web development module. The website project is worth 40%.
		We needed to have eight  pages of content, which includes the use of CSS and JavaScript. We chose a site about burritos because we thought it would be useful for students and young people, and we ourselves enjoy burritos.

		<h2> What is Networking Technologies? </h2>
			
		<p>
			Networking Technology is about designing and building computer networks. It involves the physical installation and commissioning of networks and connection to the Internet. 
			Networking Technologists are able to maintain networks, including redesigning and upgrading them. This particular programme incorporates modules on CISCO network systems.
